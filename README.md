# Fast Filter - Chicago Apartments

## Fast Filter (Chicago) is a browser extension that seeks to make online apartment hunting for Chicago units less painful. The extension eliminates the repeated action of clicking the same filters on each apartment search site; simply select the basic filters in the extension, and hit "Launch Search." 
Behind the scenes, it builds search URLs based on each site's patterns.
Built on Bootstrap utilizing Choices.JS.

Currently supports 13 apartment listing sites:
1. Apartments.com
2. Apartment Finder
3. Apartment Guide
4. Compass
5. Craigslist
6. Domu
7. ForRent.com
8. HotPads
9. Realtor.com
10. Redfin
11. Rent.com
12. Trulia
13. Zillow

## The extension also supports the saving of searches/listings. The extension grabs the URL from the current tab, and saves to the "Saved" tab. It also allows for custom names. 
This is basically the same functionality as a browser bookmark.
